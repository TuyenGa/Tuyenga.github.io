If you want to think in English, you need to **make English a part of your life.**

That's all you need to do. If you use English a lot every day, you'll automatically think in English. It will happen naturally.

How do I know this?

I know this because I've been using English for a long time. And when I think in words, I automatically thinking in my native language.

I don't intentionally try to think in English it just happens automatically.

This is because I've made English an important part of my daily life.

* I listen to English podcasts and audiobooks almost everyday.
* I practice speaking English almost everyday.
* I read something in English quite often.
* I'm writing this article in English.

If you use English all day every day, you'll be able to think in English as well.

It's simple. Choose to do everything in English whenever possible.

Here are some examples:

Do you get my point? If something can be done in both of English and in your native language, always **Chose to do it in English**.

Some people like to do everything in their native language because it's more confortable. But if you want to think in English, you have to develop the habit of using English whenever possitive.

When you make English a part of your life. Thinking in English is easy.

### Imporve your Listening and Speaking English (So that you can thing in English)

You should spend some time each day imporving your English, especially your listening and speaking skills. There skills are very important (and difficult to improve).

People don't want to use English because their English is terrible. That's why they rely on their native language so much.

If your English is excellent, you will naturally want to use English. And as you use English more and more, you'll start to think in English.

### Translating - The reason you can't think in English.

Some English students have the habit of translating between English and their native language when they use English.

This usually happens when they write and read in English.

If you have this habit, making English a part of your life is NOT enough; you also have to get rid of this bad habit.

Here's how to do that:

#### 1. Use English-to-English dictionary

Do not use dictionaries that explain word meanings in your language. Use English-to-English dictionaries instead. There are dictionaries that explain word meanings in English.

When you start using an English-to-English dictionary, you might run into this problem: 

1. You look up a word you don't know.
2. The definition of word A contains another word you don't know.
3. You have to keep looking for the meanings of new words.

The cause of dictionary program call WordWeb. It was terrible. Whenever I use it, I often ran into the problem describled above. So I switched to another dictionary, and I've never had the problem since then. (Today I use [the Oxford Dictionaries website](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/) to look up words I don't know.)

Another benefit of using English-to-English dictionaries is that it imporves your English reading skills. When you read word defintions in English, you're practicing your reading skills in English.

#### 2. Force yourself to write in English without translating.

When some students want to writing something in English, they write it in their native language first, then they translate what they wrote to English.

They tend to do this when they have to write a long email, passage, or article in English.

This is not proper way to write English. If you do this often, you must stop. If you have to write something in English, force yourself to just write in English from the start.

### Summary

Here's how you can think in English:

1. Choose to do everything in English whenever pssible.
2. Spend some time every day improveing your English (forcus on your listening and speaking skills)
3. Stop translating between English and your native language.

If you follow suggestions, you might find that, sometimes, you think in the English language.
